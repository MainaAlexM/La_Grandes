# La_Grandes
La Grandes is a sample low-income hotel website made to facilitate online presence and allow online booking of food and food delivery services in the city and surrounding locations. The website displays various foods offered at the hotel and ordering options available.

### Author
The site was designed and developed by a team of developers namely:
- Alex Mathenge,
- Irene Njeru,
- Evaline Wangu, and
- Grace Were.

## Description

### Problem
The designers were inspired by a feel for a resident who does not know where to find a low-income hotel while in the city. This gets frustrating when one realizes they can't find such a hotel website online.

### Solution
The website avails the hotel's menu and services online for free. Therefore, anyone can find it by simply browsing the internet from any location in Kenya. The site has an online ordering system that allows customers to place orders from the comfort of their homes or workplaces.

### More of the Site
Nevertheless, the services are currently optimized to suit residents visiting the city and near outskirts. A customer can order food and, make a payment online to pick up at their given time or book a space for a meal at a specific time of the day.
Beyond service, the site gives browsing clients an almost real touch of the hotel even without a prior visit.
